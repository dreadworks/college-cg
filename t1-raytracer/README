Raytracer
=========

Description
-----------

This is a raytracer written in python to render
arbitrary scenes. The scenes are defined as json files.
The shading is based upon the Phong Reflection Model. 

The geometry is completely written from scratch. All
geometrical computations (like dot products on vectors)
etc. are tested by the test_*-files. To run the testsuite
simply use nosetests.


Usage:
------

./raytracer.py worlds/task.json



Dependencies:
-------------

* Python 2.7
* PIL (or Pillow that incorporates the PIL)
